# Security Audit Report - Unplug App

## Executive Summary

This security audit was performed on the Unplug screen-time tracking app. The audit identified several security vulnerabilities in dependencies and provides recommendations for improving the overall security posture of the application.

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Critical Vulnerabilities

#### 1. xmldom Package (Critical)
- **Issue**: Multiple critical vulnerabilities in xmldom package
- **CVEs**: 
  - GHSA-h6q6-9hqw-rwfv: Misinterpretation of malicious XML input
  - GHSA-crh6-fp67-6883: Multiple root nodes in DOM allowed
  - GHSA-5fg8-2547-mr8q: Misinterpretation of malicious XML input
- **Impact**: Potential for XML injection attacks, DOM manipulation
- **Recommendation**: Update to latest version or replace with safer XML parser

#### 2. plist Package (Critical)
- **Issue**: Prototype pollution vulnerability in plist <=3.0.4
- **CVE**: GHSA-4cpg-3vgw-4877
- **Impact**: Denial of service attacks, potential code execution
- **Recommendation**: Update to plist 3.0.5 or later

### High Severity Vulnerabilities

#### 3. semver Package (High)
- **Issue**: Regular Expression Denial of Service vulnerability
- **CVE**: GHSA-c2qf-rxjj-qqgw
- **Impact**: DoS attacks through malicious version strings
- **Recommendation**: Update to semver 7.5.2 or later

### Moderate Vulnerabilities

#### 4. PostCSS Package (Moderate)
- **Issue**: Line return parsing error in PostCSS <8.4.31
- **CVE**: GHSA-7fh5-64p2-3v2j
- **Impact**: Potential parsing issues
- **Recommendation**: Update PostCSS to 8.4.31 or later

## Data Security Analysis

### User Data Handling

#### Strengths
1. **Local Storage**: User data is stored locally using ApplicationSettings
2. **No Cloud Dependencies**: Core functionality doesn't require external services
3. **Minimal Data Collection**: App only collects necessary usage data

#### Areas for Improvement
1. **Data Encryption**: User data should be encrypted at rest
2. **Data Validation**: Input validation should be strengthened
3. **Secure Backup**: Backup functionality needs encryption

### Code Security Review

#### Positive Findings
1. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: No API keys or secrets found in code
2. **Proper Error Handling**: Most errors are handled gracefully
3. **Input Sanitization**: Basic input validation is present

#### Security Concerns
1. **Eval Usage**: Check for any dynamic code execution
2. **File System Access**: Ensure proper file permissions
3. **Network Requests**: Validate all external communications

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Update Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm update plist@latest
   npm update xmldom@latest
   npm update semver@latest
   ```

2. **Implement Data Encryption**
   - Encrypt sensitive user data before storing
   - Use platform-specific secure storage APIs
   - Implement key derivation for encryption keys

3. **Add Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before storage
   - Implement proper error boundaries

### Medium Priority Actions

1. **Security Headers**
   - Implement Content Security Policy
   - Add proper CORS headers if using web views
   - Validate all external resource loading

2. **Code Signing**
   - Ensure proper code signing for iOS
   - Implement app integrity checks
   - Use certificate pinning for network requests

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Implement automated dependency scanning
   - Set up security alerts for new vulnerabilities
   - Regular security audits

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Security Testing**
   - Implement automated security testing
   - Regular penetration testing
   - Code security reviews

2. **Privacy Enhancements**
   - Implement data anonymization
   - Add user consent management
   - Provide data export/deletion features

3. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Implement security event logging
   - Add anomaly detection
   - Monitor for suspicious activities

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)
- [ ] Update vulnerable dependencies
- [ ] Implement data encryption
- [ ] Add input validation

### Phase 2: Security Hardening (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Implement security headers
- [ ] Add code signing verification
- [ ] Enhance error handling

### Phase 3: Advanced Security (Month 2)
- [ ] Implement security testing
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging
- [ ] Privacy enhancements

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR Compliance
- User consent for data processing
- Right to data portability
- Right to be forgotten
- Data minimization principles

### Mobile App Security
- OWASP Mobile Top 10 compliance
- Platform-specific security guidelines
- App store security requirements

## Conclusion

The Unplug app has a solid foundation with good local data handling practices. However, several critical dependencies need immediate attention. Implementing the recommended security measures will significantly improve the app's security posture and user trust.

The most critical actions are updating vulnerable dependencies and implementing data encryption. These should be prioritized to address the immediate security risks.
